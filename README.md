NaturalSelection

Natural Selection is an intelligent agent which operate in simulated virtual environment. The environment
is populated with competing agents, vegetation and predators. Agents consume vegetation to increase their 
energy level. However based on activity, it can decease also. Agent can sense input data in environment at 
a 45 degree angel.

Various search algorithms of artificial intelligence like breadth first search, uniform cost search and A* 
has been implemented. In order to make intelligent agent various features are implemented like information 
gathering, planning and learning to make efficient approach for longer existence in environment.

This project has been developed in scheme which is functional programming language.
